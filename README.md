# Comparison of parallel Bubble sorting on CPU and GPU.

## Overview
The goal of this task is to compare the parallelized bubble sorting method on CPU and on GPU



## CPU
#### Description:
This C# program demonstrates parallel sorting using the Bubble Sort algorithm on a GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) using the Cloo library, which provides .NET bindings for OpenCL.

#### Requirements:
- .NET Framework or .NET Core SDK installed
- OpenCL runtime installed (usually provided by GPU drivers)

#### Setup:
- Step 1:  Clone or download the repository containing the source code.
- Step 2:  Ensure that the Cloo library is referenced in the project.
- Step 3:  Build the project using Visual Studio or the command line.

#### Usage:
- Run the compiled executable.
- The program will generate an array of random integers and sort them using the Bubble Sort algorithm on the CPU.
- The sorted array will be displayed in the console output along with the execution time of the sorting process.
